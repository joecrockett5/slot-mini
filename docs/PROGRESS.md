## Phase 1: Research

- slot submodule at `e66715d`. Onion (`07505ea`) and Open MainUI (`17fe90d`)
  were cloned into a scratch folder outside the repo; re-clone them with
  `git clone --depth 1` if needed.
- `docs/PLATFORM.md`: every lead marked confirmed, corrected or unresolved.
- `docs/DESIGN-PARITY.md`: screens and effects, and what slot-mini does.
- Reference images: `docs/reference/slot-*.png`, extracted from slot's site
  media with ffmpeg.

## Open questions

- Audio: does spawning Onion's `ffplay` with `libpadsp.so` play the clips
  promptly and release the device before RetroArch starts? (Device test.)
- Cart Studio looks for a `Games/` folder beside `Labels/`; Onion has `Roms/`.
- slot's art service (`art.slot-cfw.fyi`) has not approved third-party use;
  the client ships disabled.
